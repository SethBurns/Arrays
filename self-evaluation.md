### How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

On a scale of 1-10, I feel about a 7 or 8 on the Array content so far.

### Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

I would like to practice more and understand the different array methods I can use and what they do exactly. I feel like I can't 100% predict what a `console.log()` will produce.

### What questions do you have about Arrays?

With pop and shift, it seems the array itself is changed. With slice, it seems like the array itself goes unchanged, so I feel that bit is inconsistent, and I want to understand why, or at least the application of each method.
